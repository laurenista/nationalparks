      <div class="text-block">On this map, you can find the location of every U.S. National Park. There are 63 declared National Parks in the United States, California leading with 9. 

The parks are separated by places I've visited and places I have yet to visit (obviously I have a lot of work to do). Locations marked by a square = visited and those marked by a circle = unvisited.</div>
